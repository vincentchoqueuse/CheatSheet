# Introduction

## Why Python

Python is a multipurpose interpreted language that provides many packages for scripting, plotting, data science, web developement, and more. Python has a beautiful syntax and is easy to learn. This language has become extremely popular in one decade. Python is usually considered as a first-choice language for many programmers. Many universities have decided to use the Python language for programming courses.

### How to Install Python

My recommended way to install python on your machine \(whatever your OS\) is to install the Anaconda distribution. This distribution contains many installed package for data science such as Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib or Jupyter. The Anaconda distribution is quite stable and there is a very small probability that the installation goes wrong with your computer

* [Install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads)

At the end of the installation process, please make sure to add anaconda in `PATH`

### How to use Python

There are several options to write your code in Python and to run your script. To write your code, the most simple solution is to use a simple text editor. To run your script, you can use your OS terminal. To simplify the process, I recommend to use an IDE such as VScode from Microsoft and to install the Python Extension.

For particular homeworks, I also recommend my students to use Jupyter Notebook. This web environment allows to add text, equations, python code, figures in a single file. Note that Jupyter is included in the Anaconda Python distribution.
